# windowMechanismArduino

This is version of the base program I developed as a private contractor for restoring all windows and window functions of a 1974 Toyota FJ40. The code was developed using a custom made debugging shield for the UNO R3 Arduino board.


This code programs the Arduino microcontroller to perform all the expected functions of a car window with a focus on the longevity of power relays. The window functionality includes the typical directional commands (up vs down), automatic rolling on quick press, and automatic killswitch from voltage delta or canceling press.
