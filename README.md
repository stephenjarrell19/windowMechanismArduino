# windowMechanismArduino
This code programs the Arduino microcontroller to perform all the expected functions of a car window. This includes directional commands (up vs down), automatic rolling on quick press, and automatic killswitch from voltage delta or canceling press. This is version of the base program I developed for a 1974 Toyota FJ40.
